## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaSript

### What I learned

I learned more on flexbox centering and grid, very interesting. learned how align-self works. And my use of padding improved



```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  dislay: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-self: center
}
```


### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16180107/arrow-box-with-css) - This helped me for creating the menu container for the mobile screen size. Had to work my way around it. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
