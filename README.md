## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaSript

### What I learned

I learned more on flexbox centering and grid, very interesting. learned how align-self works. And my use of padding improved



```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  dislay: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-self: center
}
```


### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16180107/arrow-box-with-css) - This helped me for creating the menu container for the mobile screen size. Had to work my way around it. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
